There are several steps to a debate: different stages.

Each debate involves two debating teams who take opposing sides of the topic, either affirmative (for) or negative (against). The teams alternate speakers. The affirmative team speaks in support of the topic. Their goal is to persuade others that the topic is true.


A debate will always start with an introductory statement from both sides where, in the certain amount of time given, the opposing side is not allowed to reply to your statements.

Next is a main statement from each side where there are allowed to be replies from the opposing side.

Finally is an open stage where all sides are allowed to state any points with replies from the opposing side before the audience votes on the winner of the debate.
